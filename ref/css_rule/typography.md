- The defulat typeface aka font-family is Times New Roman.
- Limit the number of typefaces uesed on a web page to 2 or 3.
- When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized), like "Courier New"
- font-weight has normaol and bold. 400 is the defult of most text, 700 is bold, 300 is light.
- header is where the navigation menu is, then banner is the img following.
- word-spacing is used for increase the spacing between words in a body of text. 0.25em, 0.3em. The preferred unit is ems.
- letter-spacing is used for increase the spacing between individual letters.
- text-transform is used for change between uppercase and lowercase.
- text-align is used for change between left, center, right.
- line-height used to make text on a web page easier to read.
-- A unitless number, such as 1.2. This number is an absolute value that will compute the line height as a ratio of the font size.
-- A number specified by unit, such as 12px. This number can be any valid CSS unit, such as pixels, percents, ems, or rems.

Generally, the unitless ratio value is the preferred method, since it is responsive and based exclusively on the current font size. In other words, if we change the font size, a unitless line-height would automatically readjust, whereas the pixel value would remain static.
- Fallback Fonts. font-family: "Garamond", "Times", serif;
it says:
Use the Garamond font for all <h1> elements on the web page.
If Garamond is not available, use the Times font.
If Garamond and Times are not available, use any serif font pre-installed on the userâ€™s computer.
-  Fallback fonts help ensure a consistent experience for the diverse audience of users that visit a site.
- Linking Fonts: Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts. (with font-weight and font-sytle properties.) http://fonts.google.com/
Then add <link href...> to <head>
add font-family: "" to css
- Another way is dont use <link>, but font-face:
copy the font link to browser, then focus on latin. add it to .css top
- if you dont want the google style, you can modify @font-face to use local as well.
<pre><code>
@font-face {
  font-family: "name";
  src: url("relative-path") format('format');
}
</code></pre>
then you could use in the selecter with font-family:"name".
