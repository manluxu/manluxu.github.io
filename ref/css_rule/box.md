All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as “living” inside of a box. This is what is meant by the box model.

For example, when you change the background color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.

In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following aspects of the box model:

- The dimensions of an element’s box.
- The borders of an element’s box.
- The paddings of an element’s box.
- The margins of an element’s box.

following properties impact an element’s display:

- height
- width
- padding
- border
- margin
- overflow

The properties include:

- Width and height — specifies the width and height of the content area.
- Padding — specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.
- Border — specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
- Margin — specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.
